More than a hundred tenants sent complaints to the Competition Bureau demanding an investigation into landlords’ use of YieldStar in Canada. Tenants protested outside the Competition Bureau in Toronto demanding an investigation into landlords’ use of rental software. Tenants in Cynthia Black's building participated in a red flag protest by hanging flags from their balconies to warn tenants about the rent hikes. Tenants in West22 have had red flags hanging from their balconies for the past year. Some tenants flagged their concerns to local MPP Bhutila Karpoche. Bhutila Karpoche researched the issue and found YieldStar has been used in Canada since at least 2017. Federal Minister François-Philippe Champagne said he would write to the competition commissioner to launch an investigation into the allegations around price-fixing in the rental market. Dream instructed its property manager to discontinue its use of YieldStar in September. Dream stated that its pricing decisions have always been made solely by its management team based on publicly available data and information specific to its buildings. Dream denied that rent prices were in any way impacted by the software.
