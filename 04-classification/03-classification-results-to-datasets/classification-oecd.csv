Six of Meta's 11 US fact-checking partners review content in Spanish. Meta removes Spanish-language voter interference content from its platforms. Meta connects people with authoritative information in Spanish through voting alerts and the Voting Information Center. Meta invested $5 million in media literacy initiatives ahead of the midterms, including fact-checking services on WhatsApp. YouTube applies its misinformation policies globally and says it applies them consistently regardless of language. YouTube employs more than 20,000 people around the world to review and remove content that violates its policies, including Spanish-speaking employees. Twitter is working with organizations such as the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials and MiFamiliaVota to promote voter registration. Twitter is working with the Spanish Language Disinformation Coalition to inform its policies on misinformation ahead of the midterms. TikTok launched an election center in more than 45 languages to flag inaccurate content and connect users to authoritative information. The advocacy coalition Change the Terms attempted to engage with major tech companies including Meta, TikTok, and Google regarding Spanish misinformation on their platforms. Change the Terms asked YouTube for more information on how well it is policing Spanish election misinformation. Change the Terms asked Facebook to ban theories that the 2020 election was stolen on its platforms.
